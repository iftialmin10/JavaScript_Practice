Event propagation bubbling and capturing:
In html when a event call , first target location is selected and parents 
to child go to the target from document and capture it. After capturing 
done start reverse to upward and this process occured by child to 
parents(called bubbling) until the document position reach. On the whole 
way of travelling of bubbling any parents can access the target value for
his own purpose.
